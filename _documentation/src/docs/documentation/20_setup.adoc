== Setup

In order to interact with a given Gitlab instance through its REST API, `u-needs-work` needs to be authorized and authenticated. To do so, together with Gitlab's instance URL, an API token must be provided. 

=== GitLab: Generate an API Token

You will need a https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html[personal access token] or a https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html[group access] in order for the tool to interact with your repositories on GitLab.

All the actions are done using the REST API of GitLab.

You will need the `api` scope.

If you use a Group token, you will need the `Developer` role, since the tool is posting comments on Merge Request.

=== Application Setup

Some configurations are available for `u-needs-work`:

.Example `application.properties` file
----
gitlab.host=https://gitlab.com
gitlab.api.token=glpat-rXzx1n17cqUnmo437XSf
----

You can use any of the https://quarkus.io/guides/config-reference#configuration-sources[Configuration Sources supported by Quarkus] to set the values.
For example you can use following system property to set the `gitlab.api.token` value:

.Setting `gitlab.api.token` using a system property:
----
export GITLAB_API_TOKEN=glpat-rXzx1n17cqUnmo437XSf
----

==== GitLab host

Specify the location of the GitLab server:

* key: `gitlab.host`
* default value `https://gitlab.com`

==== GitLab api token

Specify the api token value used when `u-needs-work` is performing REST calls.

* key: `gitlab.api.token`
* No default value.
* Mandatory for the application to start

=== GitLab: Webhook Setup

In the corresponding repository or group configure a https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html[Webhook] pointing to the location where `u-needs-work` is available:

* URL: `<server url>/u-needs-work/event`
* Trigger: `Comments events`

WARNING: From an operational point of view, it might be safer to deploy `u-needs-work` to a server where only your GitLab instance has access.

Read more about the different available xref:30_endpoints.adoc[endpoints].

== Dev setup

The application can be started locally, check xref:50_build.adoc#local[local build] section.

=== Working with a remote GitLab instance

If you are working locally with a remote gitlab instance (like https://gitlab.com/), adding some proxy might be useful:

With a tool like https://ngrok.com/[ngrok] you will get a public url (something like `https://2a01-8943-19d-e0a-8b20-645f-f7a2-c2d-9be1.ngrok.io`) that points to your localhost computer.

.start ngrok (assuming `u-needs-work` is running locally on port 8080)
----
ngrok http 8080
----

With a tool like https://mitmproxy.org/[mitmproxy] you can proxy the remote instance to capture the REST requests made by `u-needs-work` to the remote instance:

.start mitmproxy
----
mitmproxy -p 8888 --mode reverse:https://gitlab.com
----

And then make `u-needs-work` use `localhost:8888` instead of `gitlab.com` directly:

.use mitmproxy
----
export GITLAB_HOST=http://localhost:8888
----
