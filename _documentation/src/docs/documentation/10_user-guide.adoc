== User guide

Suppose you have a setup where `u-needs-work` is already configured correctly (see xref:20_setup.adoc[Setup]).

On any merge request, if a user post a review (or a comment) containing "ðŸ”§" (the `:wrench:` emoji) or "needs work" then an additional comment will be added to the MR timeline by the `u-needs-work` tool.

Using the "New changes since the comment." link, you can access the diff view where you compare the changes since your last review.

NOTE: Comments or threads on the "Changes" tab are ignored (when you post a remark on the code in the diff view). The "needs work" message has to be posted on the review summary dialog, or directly in the "Overview" tab.
