== Endpoints

=== Main endpoint

[source, http]
----
POST <server url>/u-needs-work/event
----

This is the principal endpoint, that receive the https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhook_events.html#comment-events[Comment Webhook event] sent by GitLab.

Requests are processed asynchronously, meaning that GitLab will receive a `202 Accepted` response back immediately.

Example:

[source, json]
----
include::u-needs-work-non-blocking-response.json[]
----

* `build_commit` and `build_timestamp` allow you to identify the `u-needs-work` version.
* `gitlab_event_uuid` is the value received in the `X-Gitlab-Event-UUID` header.

=== Blocking endpoint

A secondary endpoint where the process in done in a blocking way is available as well:

[source, http]
----
POST <server url>/u-needs-work/event-blocking
----

With this blocking endpoint you get more information about the created comment in the returned response.

Example:

[source, json]
----
include::u-needs-work-blocking-response.json[]
----

Since GitLab keeps the response obtained when delivering a webhook event and displays it in the webhook admin page, using this endpoint might be interesting for debugging purpose.

=== Replay endpoint

An additional endpoint is available to trigger the process using some simplified input compared to comment event body sent by the GitLab Webhook API.

[source, http]
----
POST <server url>/u-needs-work/replay
----

Body:

[source, json]
----
include::u-needs-work-replay.json[]
----

The response is the same as in the blocking case.

Using this endpoint is interesting to trigger again the `u-needs-work` action for a given event using `curl`, without having to send the complete webhook event body.

=== Readiness and liveness probes

The application provides standard probes:

* `<server url>/q/health/live`: The application is up and running (liveness).
* `<server url>/q/health/ready`: The application is ready to serve requests (readiness).
* `<server url>/q/health`: Accumulating all health check procedures in the application.

=== Info endpoint

The application provides some information about the current version:

* `<server url>/q/info`

This can be turned off with the quarkus configuration property `quarkus.info.enabled` set to `false`.
